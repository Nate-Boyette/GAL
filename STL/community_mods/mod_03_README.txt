This was a community requested mod for better ease of use of the selector_knob.
It can be dropped in as a replacement for the main 10_GAL_lid.stl, with the same assembly instructions.

There is also a 'reordered' lid, 'mod_03_GAL_Lid_reordered.stl', which has a slightly reordered mode selector. In order to use this lid, you will need to reprogram the PCB using the 'CODE_reordered.ino' file under the 'CODE' folder.
